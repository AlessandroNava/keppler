# Keppler

An efficient way to share your code while presenting

### What is keppler

Keppler lets you share your code during a presentation.

Start keppler inside your project folder, share the URL with the viewers and start coding. When you save or change any files, viewers receive them, can browse through the files tree and discover changes you've made.

Keppler is easy to install and works with NodeJS.
